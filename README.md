throttle async and promise-returning functions.  Other packages don't do it right.

## Installing

```sh
npm install --save @jcoreio/async-throttle
```

### Usage

```js
import throttle from '@jcoreio/async-throttle'
```

```js
function throttle<Args: Array<any>, Value>(
  func: (...args: Args) => Promise<Value>,
  wait: ?number,
  options?: {
    getNextArgs?: (current: Args, next: Args) => Args
  }
): (...args: Args) => Promise<Value>;
```

Creates a throttled function that only invokes `func` at most once per every `wait` milliseconds, and also waits for the
`Promise` returned by the previous invocation to finish (it won't invoke `func` in parallel).

The promise returned by the throttled function will track the promise returned by the next invocation of `func`.

If `wait` is falsy, it is treated as 0, which causes `func` to be invoked on the next tick afte the previous invocation
finishes.

By default, `func` is called with the most recent arguments to the throttled function.  You can change this with the
`getNextArgs` option -- for example, if you want to invoke `func` with the minimum of all arguments since the last
invocation:
```js
const throttled = throttle(foo, 10, {
  getNextArgs: ([a], [b]) => [Math.min(a, b)]
})
throttled(2)
throttled(1)
throttled(3)
// foo will be called with 1

// time passes...

throttled(4)
throttled(6)
throttled(5)
// foo will be called with 4
```
